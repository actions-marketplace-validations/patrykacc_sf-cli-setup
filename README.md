# SF (SFDX) CLI Setup - Github Action 
### Easily setup and cache SF CLI

Main: ![Health check](https://github.com/patrykacc/sf-cli-setup/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)

Action provides easy way to start working with sf cli in your github workflows.
Installing cli using this action is much more effective than using sfdx container:
- 1 line to install and cache
- waaay faster ðŸš€
- no need to everytime pull image for each run
- automatic caching provided by action itself
- running on runner directly allows to use runner preinstalled tools, eg. java, chromium, node

## Quickstart:

Put this line into job in your workflow:

`- uses: patrykacc/sf-cli-setup@main`

And you are all set


## Example:
```
on:
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: patrykacc/sf-cli-setup@main

      - name: CLI Health check
        run: |
          echo "CLI Installed succesfuly!"
          sf -v
```
